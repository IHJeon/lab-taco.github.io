### Let’s enjoy TACO together!

Are you interested in building theories based on scanty neuroscience data?You can be another Sherlock Holmes, who pursues the solid truth by finding a needle in the haystack, and who answers the findings in mathematical form eventually. So far, our attempt was limited in the region, cerebellum, but we are heading to more ambitious goal. That’s why we are trying to find motivated people. Join us as a Ph.D. student, or an intern, or a post-doc.!
